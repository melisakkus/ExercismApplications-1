//Instructions
//You're an avid bird watcher that keeps track of how many birds have visited your garden in the last seven days.
//You have six tasks, all dealing with the numbers of birds that visited your garden.

//1)For comparison purposes, you always keep a copy of last week's counts nearby, which were: 0, 2, 5, 3, 7, 8 and 4.
//Implement the (static) BirdCount.LastWeek() method that returns last week's counts:

//2)Implement the BirdCount.Today() method to return how many birds visited your garden today.
//The bird counts are ordered by day, with the first element being the count of the oldest day, and the last element
//being today's count.

//3)Implement the BirdCount.IncrementTodaysCount() method to increment today's count:
//4)Implement the BirdCount.HasDayWithoutBirds() method that returns true if there was a day at which zero birds
//visited the garden; otherwise, return false:
//5)Implement the BirdCount.CountForFirstDays() method that returns the number of birds that have visited your garden
//from the start of the week, but limit the count to the specified number of days from the start of the week.
//6)Some days are busier that others. A busy day is one where five or more birds have visited your garden.
//Implement the BirdCount.BusyDays() method to return the number of busy days:
